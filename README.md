# quicker-copper
Makes copper oxidize quicker*</br>

*The default is lower but can get higher by more than double the default</br>

The default chance for oxidization with this mod is 4% ( minecraft default is 5.688889% ) but with every oxidizable block around it in a cube that is more oxidized will add 0.8% ( max of 6.4% ), and every water block around it increases the chance by 0.4% ( max of 3.2% ). Also when it is raining the chance is increased by 2%.
